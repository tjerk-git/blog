At [CMD LWD](https://blog.cmdlwd.nl/) we like to challenge our students to start their own side-projects.
But what my co-workers and I noticed is that students who are new in this design field often don't have creative input for their own fun hobby projects.

That's where we want to help and inspire them.
There are lots of random creative brief tools out there, but noticed they are all so boring and corporate.

How is designing a e-commerce app for sporting goods a fun and challenging side-project to endeavour?
By giving them crazy design prompts, curated by us @[Thomas](https://krokodil.design) and Gonzalo.
